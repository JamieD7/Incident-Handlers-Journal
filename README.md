# Incident-Handlers-Journal
This repository is dedicated to using an incident handlers journal.  I used the journal to record my findings after completing a lab as well as a way to log the key takeaways about different cybersecurity tools and concpets I encountered. (Project was done through Google Cybersecurity Certificate Lab)
